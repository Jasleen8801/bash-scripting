# Bash Shell Scripting

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a shell scripting language for Linux operating systems

## Prerequisites

To run the Bash scripts in this project, you will need:

- A Unix-like environment (e.g., Linux or macOS)
- Bash shell (version 4 or later)

# Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
```

2. Change into the project directory

```bash
cd bash-scripting
```

## Usage

To run a Bash script, navigate to the project directory and execute the desired script using the Bash interpreter. For example:

```bash
bash script.sh
```

To check whether you're actually running in bash shell, run:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

Make sure to provide necessary executable permissions to the script if required:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

Also, provided you've configured the whole setup, to run the script, follow the command:

```bash
./script.sh
```
